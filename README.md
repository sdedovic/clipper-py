# About
clipper-py is a Boost.Python wrapper exposing the C++ translation of the Angus Johnson's Clipper library (6.4 Rev 495).

clipper-py is tested and built against Python 3.8 on Arch Linux.

**This project is very much a work-in-progress. Please contribute.**

## About Clipper
> Clipper - an open source freeware library for clipping and offsetting lines and polygons.
>
> The Clipper library performs line & polygon clipping - intersection, union, difference & exclusive-or, and line & polygon offsetting. The library is based on Vatti's clipping algorithm.
>
> Angus Johnson's Clipper library

# Install
### Dependencies
- Boost.Python Headers (`libboost-python-dev`) compiled against version `1.72.0`

### From PyPI
pip install pyclipper

### From source
CMake required.

#### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:fonttools/pyclipper.git
```

#### Install:
```bash
python setup.py install
```

# Usage
### Basic clipping example (based on Angus Johnson's Clipper library):
```python
from pyclipper import Path, Paths, Clipper, IntPoint

subj = Paths()
subj.push(Path().push(IntPoint(180, 200)).push(IntPoint(260, 200)).push(IntPoint(260, 150)).push(IntPoint(180, 150)))
subj.push(Path().push(IntPoint(215, 160)).push(IntPoint(230, 190)).push(IntPoint(200, 190)))
print(subj, subj[0], subj[1])

clip = Paths()
clip.push(Path().push(IntPoint(190, 210)).push(IntPoint(240, 210)).push(IntPoint(240, 130)).push(IntPoint(190, 130)))
print(clip, clip[0])

clipper = Clipper(0)
clipper.add_paths(subj, 'subject', True)
clipper.add_paths(clip, 'clip', True)
solution = clipper.execute('intersection', 'non-zero', 'non-zero')

# solution (a list of paths): [[[240, 200], [190, 200], [190, 150], [240, 150]], [[200, 190], [230, 190], [215, 160]]]
```
